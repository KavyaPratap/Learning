# 📚 Learning Repository Contribution Guide
A centralized repository containing every club member's learning goals and projects.

# 🛠️ Phase 1: Creating Your Learning Folder
1. Fork the Learning repository. (This creates a copy on your GitHub account where you can make changes.)

2. Go to the + button next to <> CODE.

3. Then click on Create new file.

4. Above the editor, you will see Learning/[input box].

5. In the input box type: <your_name>/.gitignore

# 📝 Phase 2: Committing Your Changes

**optional**Add Your Files: In the editor area below, you can add content to your .gitignore file.

**Note: The .gitignore file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, like local configuration files.**

6. Click the Commit changes... button at the top-right or bottom of the page.

7. Type a short, descriptive commit message (e.g., "Add <your_name> folder and .gitignore"). **[optional], but always a good practise.**

8. Ensure the radio button is selected for "Commit directly to the <your_branch_name> branch" (your forked branch).

9. Click Commit changes.

# 🚀 Phase 3: Create the Pull Request (PR)
10. Navigate back to the main page of your forked repository.

11. Look for the banner indicating recent pushes and click the "Compare & pull request" button, or go to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request".

12. Verify Branch Settings: Ensure the branches are correctly set:

+ base repository: The original club repository.

+ base: The branch in the original repo you want to merge into (likely main or master).

+ head repository: Your forked repository.

+ compare: The branch in your fork that has your changes.

+ Give your Pull Request a clear and descriptive Title and Description. (The description should briefly explain what you added, e.g., "Adds my learning folder and initial .gitignore file").

13. Click the Create pull request button.

🎉 Success!

Your Pull Request is now open. A maintainer will review your changes and then merge them into the main project.
